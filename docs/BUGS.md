# Bugs and backlog

Working list. Anything reported from real use lands here first, so it survives a lost session and
is not stuck in a chat transcript.

**Conventions.** Each entry says what you *see*, not what the code does — the diagnosis belongs in
the fix. A fixed entry keeps its commit so the regression test is findable. Anything with a
reproducing test names it; anything without one says so, because "fixed" without a test here means
"believed fixed".

Status: `open` · `fixed` · `wontfix` · `needs-repro`

## Open

### B-07 · Cmd+A in a block doesn't select its text
**Status:** open · **Severity:** high · **Found:** 2026-09-11, while writing e2e tests

Pressing Cmd+A (Ctrl+A) while editing a block does not select that block's text. It detaches the
editor and swallows the following keystroke — typing `persisted` after it produced
`seedersisted`, i.e. the `p` vanished and the caret jumped to the end.

Expected: select the block's text first, and only escalate to selecting sibling blocks on a second
press (`docs/spec/commands-and-keymap.md`). No keystroke should ever be dropped.

No test yet — `e2e/tests/editing.spec.ts` deliberately avoids Cmd+A so the suite tests the app
rather than this bug.

### B-08 · References panel always present, no counts, not collapsible
**Status:** open · **Severity:** medium · **Reported:** 2026-09-11

Linked and unlinked references render as sections even when there are none, show no count, and
cannot be collapsed. Should show `Linked references (3)`, collapse/expand, and disappear entirely
when empty.

`apps/web/src/views/ReferencesPanel.tsx`.

---

### B-09 · References don't refresh after a local edit
**Status:** open · **Severity:** medium · **Found:** 2026-09-11, reading the code for B-08

`useLinkedReferences` and `useSearchResults` are server-backed and deliberately not wired to the
local change bus (`apps/web/src/data/store.ts`), exposing a manual `refetch` instead — but nothing
calls it. So adding a `[[link]]` does not update the panel until navigation.

Related to B-05's root cause but a separate path: those two resources bypass the version stamping.

---

### B-10 · A failed request renders as a permanent spinner
**Status:** open · **Severity:** high · **Reported:** 2026-09-11 (as "searching for aa just stops at Searching…")

`SearchView` has a loading branch and a results branch but no error branch, so a rejected fetch
leaves "Searching…" on screen forever. The underlying 401 was B-01, but the *invisibility* is its
own bug and will hide the next failure too.

Every view that can fail needs an error state. Same applies to the references panel's "Loading…".

---

### B-11 · No diagnostics surface
**Status:** open · **Severity:** medium · **Requested:** 2026-09-11

Nothing in the UI says whether the client reached the API, whether it has a token (and if not,
why), how big the search index is, or whether embedding indexing is running. B-01 was invisible for
exactly this reason. `data/bootstrap.ts` already carries a `reason` field for this.

Wanted: a settings/dev panel with connection state, backend reachability, index size, indexing
progress.

---

### B-12 · Two CSS naming schemes in the editor
**Status:** open · **Severity:** low · **Found:** 2026-09-11

`BlockRowView` uses `.vr-row` / `.vr-content` / `.vr-block-view`; `VirtualJournalDay` uses
`.block-tree` / `.block-row` / `.block-content-input` for the same concepts. Confusing to style and
to write selectors against. Fold into one scheme during the design pass.

---

### B-13 · UI is visually unfinished
**Status:** open · **Severity:** medium · **Reported:** 2026-09-11

Verbatim: "looks absolutely barebones… like first project in life design." Needs a real typographic
scale, spacing rhythm, and focus/hover states.

---

### B-14 · No context menu on a bullet
**Status:** open · **Severity:** medium · **Requested:** 2026-09-11

Right-clicking a bullet should open an app-specific menu (zoom in, indent/outdent, toggle task,
copy block ref, delete) rather than the browser's default.

## Fixed

All six below were reported within minutes of first opening a served production build, and all six
had passed the 1,180-test unit suite. That is what `e2e/` now exists to prevent — see its
`playwright.config.ts` header.

### B-01 · Served client had no API credentials
**Status:** fixed · `d6163df` · **Test:** `e2e/tests/connectivity.spec.ts`

Search 401'd, linked references hung, `/ui/live` reported "agents can't see this window", and the
sync indicator flapped offline→syncing→offline every few seconds. One cause: the token came from
`VITE_NOOKLET_TOKEN`, a dev-only stand-in that is undefined in a production build. The server now
injects a per-process token as `window.__NOOKLET__`, for loopback callers only.

### B-02 · Editing stopped after exactly one character
**Status:** fixed · `d6163df` · **Test:** `e2e/tests/editing.spec.ts`, "types a whole sentence"

`<For each={rows()}>` keyed on objects rebuilt by `flattenVisible` on every refetch, so each
keystroke recreated every row's DOM and tore out the element the single CodeMirror surface is
re-parented into. Now keyed by block id.

### B-03 · Clicking a block entered edit mode without focus
**Status:** fixed · `d6163df` · **Test:** `e2e/tests/rendering.spec.ts`, "clicking a seeded row"

The clicked `.vr-block-view` is swapped out of the DOM inside the click handler, so the browser
reset focus to `<body>` after the handler returned, undoing `view.focus()`. Re-asserted on the next
frame. Deliberately *not* moved to `mousedown`, which fires before link clicks and would break
`[[page]]` navigation.

### B-04 · Typed text vanished on blur, reappeared on reload
**Status:** fixed · `d6163df` · **Test:** `e2e/tests/editing.spec.ts`, "text survives blurring"

Two causes. See B-05 for why the UI didn't update; separately, a typed edit could be lost for real:
writes are debounced ~500 ms and nothing flushed on blur or unload, so clicking away and reloading
inside that window discarded it. Now flushed on `focusout` past the tree, `pagehide`, and
`visibilitychange`.

### B-05 · Nothing refetched after a write
**Status:** fixed · `d6163df` · **Test:** covered by B-04's test and "a page seeded through the API"

Global. Every resource source called `trackTable`/`trackPage` and then returned a stable scalar (an
id, a name, or literally `true`); `createResource` refetches only when the source *value* changes,
so Solid never re-ran the fetcher. Local edits reached SQLite and the UI kept rendering the
previous result until a reload. Sources now return a version-stamped object.

### B-06 · Enter dropped the next two keystrokes
**Status:** fixed · `d6163df` · **Test:** `e2e/tests/editing.spec.ts`, "Enter creates a second bullet"

Surfaced by fixing B-05: a refetch landing before the write committed overwrote the optimistic row
and unmounted the new block's editor, so `second bullet` arrived as `cond bullet`. The block being
edited is now preserved when absent from a query result.

## Notes for whoever picks this up

- `pnpm e2e` builds the client, boots a real server on a temp data dir, and drives Chromium. It is
  the only suite that would have caught B-01 through B-06.
- When a bug is "it doesn't update", check `data/store.ts` first — B-05's pattern was replicated
  across eight resources and is easy to reintroduce.
- Bugs found while fixing other bugs (B-06, B-09, B-12) are worth recording even when small; three
  of the entries above exist only because something else was being read carefully.
